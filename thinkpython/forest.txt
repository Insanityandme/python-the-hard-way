*END*THE SMALL PRINT!
On some occasions I get a feeling of lonely despair, and this particular emotion dwells inside me through my mind and makes a hollow room of ambiguity. Every time I encounter this my physical body aces as if the feeling were alive and dangerous. The more it penetrates my mind the deeper I get into the forest, and as time goes the straying gets exponential. I have had some guidance through experience, thou probably illusionary, that the trees don’t look at me as a stranger anymore, rather merely as a disoriented creature. Whenever I get lost in this epic wilder forest I get an immediate response of bewildered apprehension, it almost feels like a tree-induced vertigo, and possibly originates from a fear of losing myself. The paradox nature of this response is that it emerges from the environment, it arises when I don’t recognise the trees around me, the colourful mushrooms or the dark green moss that lays on the ground. Because of this I have struggled with the concept of self, do I only cognisant myself in the presence of other things, may it be animate objects or inanimate objects, or is this mono-relationship just a reflection of my strange need of having control. Through many wanderings in the forest of my mind I have had some insights to handle this strange feeling of lonely despair. First insight: don’t fear the straying, it’s through this undesignated journey that my mind expands and acquire less confinement. Second insight: don’t hang on to the materia of exterior, this might inhibit you from self-progression.
