*END*THE SMALL PRINT!
I wasn't there when you needed me
You never let me in your life
I didn't say what bothered me
You sure said more than that
The silence that followed didn't do us any good
And it seems like you settled for me
Cause I was the best that you could get 
But there wasn't enough
I know what you want and you're not the one for me

I've been leaving you since the day we met
And it feels like you have too
I remember when I met you
The day I saw your smile
And now it's time to let go, oh, it's time to feel alive

The problems I had with you 
Are the ones you had with me
Even though we were holding love
We both know we drifted apart
I guess this is it ? why bother when there's nothing left
When neither you nor me are here
Growing bitter and uncomfortably numb
Losing what we had
At least we tried but it wasn't meant to be

I've been leaving you since the day we met
And it feels like you have too
The reasons that I loved you
Are the ones that made me go
The reasons that I loved you
Oh, I've got to let you low, know ?

I should have seen it coming, should have known what to expect
I should have seen the signs, should have known that it was wrong

I've been leaving you since the day that we met
And it feels like you have too

The reasons that I loved you
Oh, are the ones that made me go
The reasons that I loved you
Oh, I got to let you low, know ?

I am sorry that we got here
But I'm glad, glad that we are done
I don't wanna go back there
Cause the love I felt is gone
Cause the love I felt is gone
