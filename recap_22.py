# Exercise 3: Numbers and Math
# To use fractions, you need to use a floating point number. 
# As in 1.0 (decimal)
print "some string" 
print 3+3
print 2-2
print 4/4
print 5*5

# modulus spits out the remainder of the division (16 % 4 = 0)
print 100 - 25 * 3 % 4
print "Is it greater?", 2 > 1
print "Is it less?", 2 < 1
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
